# CIFAR-Classification
Classification of CIFAR dataset using python, tensorflow and keras backend using multi layer perceptron algorithm. Includes Fully Connected neural network, Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization, Dropout, L1 &amp; L2 Regularization techniques.

The CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 are labeled subsets of the 80 million tiny images dataset.
They were collected by Alex Krizhevsky, Vinod Nair, and Geoffrey Hinton.
The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000
images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images.
The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each consisting 10000
images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The
training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches
may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches
contain exactly 5000 images from each class.

This repository elaborates on the techniques in deep learning that is used for classifying the CIFAR 10 data set.

Following technologies are adopted in order to classify the Cifar 10 dataset.

1. Python-
Python version python-3.5.4-amd64 was used.

2. Tensorflow-
Tensorflow version 1.11.0 was used.

3. Keras-
Keras version 2.2.4 was used.
Keras is an open source neural network Python library which can run on top of other machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, CNTK or Theano

4. IDE- PyCharmIDE

Six deep learning techniques was used. They are

I. Fully Connected Network

II. Batch Normalization

III. Layer Normalization

IV. Dropout

V. L1 Regression (Lasso Regression)

VI. L2 Regression (Ridge Regression)
